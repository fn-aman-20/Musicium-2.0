## About This Repo
This is a modified version of the original Musicium Discord bot repo at <a href='https://github.com/Tomato6966/Musicium'>Tomato6966/Musicium</a>. If you consider using it do not forget to give proper credits to the developers.
### Issues Fixed
* Song and Queue loops weren't working as intended
* Lyrics were disabled by default, now available (from genius.com)
* Removed unwanted/malfunctioning commands
* Removed default filter command as the same filter not always gives the good quality but reduces the volume instead
* Customized the player, queue, and filters
### How To Fork This Repo
* Copy the GitHub URL of this repo
* Open replit and create a new repl
* Click import from GitHub and paste the URL
* Add a new secret named `main_auth` and enter your bot token
* For copyright reasons no changes have been made to the dashboard
### How To Make It 24/7 Online
* Simply run the bot and copy the URL in the mini window that pops up aside, above the shell/console
* Go to <a href='https://freshping.io/'>freshping.io</a>, make a new account and add a new check
* Paste the copied URL in and make sure you set the check interval to 1min
* Your bot would however, need a manual start once every 24 - 48 hours (won't go offline but lag a lot, for both text and voice aka response time)
* You can fix it by either getting a dedicated host or buying the replit hacker plan
